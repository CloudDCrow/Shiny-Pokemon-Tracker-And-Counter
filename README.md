## How it Works
1. Search for the Pokemon you want to hunt by its Pokedex number or name.
2. Start the hunt.
3. Increase the count by 1 for every wild encounter or by 5 if you're using the Masuda method. 
4. Click "Done!" once you finally get the shiny.
5. Stores your completed hunts in the box below to see all the shinies you've caught so far, complete with images and encounter count.
6. Get ready for your next shiny hunt and repeat
