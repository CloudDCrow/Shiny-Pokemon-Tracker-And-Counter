# Shiny-Pokemon-Tracker-And-Counter
Keeps count of the pokemon encounters while shiny hunting and keeps track of already caught shinies.

Type in the pokedex number or name of a pokemon and the shiny sprite of that pokemon will appear.
You can add +1 for a wild encounter or +5 if you are doing the masuda method.
Once the shiny pokemon has been caught, the pokemon will be added to the box below, where all of your caught shinies will be stored.
Next to the shiny pokemon that you caught, there will also be the number of encounters that it took to catch it.
