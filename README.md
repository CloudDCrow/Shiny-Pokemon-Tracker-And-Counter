## How It Works

1. Search for the Pokemon you want to hunt by its Pokedex number or name.
2. Start the hunt.
3. Increase the count by 1 for every wild encounter or by 5 if you're using the Masuda method.
4. Click "Done!" once you finally get the shiny, or if you wish to save the hunt for later.
5. If you wish to continue the hunt at a later time, the hunt will be stored in "Saved hunts".
6. View all the shinies you've caught so far, complete with images and encounter count in the box below.
7. Get ready for your next shiny hunt and repeat.

## Pokemon Forms

Some Pokemon have different forms. To search for them, use the following words:

- **Regional Forms:**
  - For regional forms, use the region the Pokemon is from before the name.
  - Example: Paldean Wooper

- **Other Forms:**
  - For other forms, use the full form's name.
  - Example: Deoxys Speed, Toxtricity Low, Basculegion Female, ...
